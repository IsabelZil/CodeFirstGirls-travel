          <h2>My dream destination</h2>
          <p>
            The northern lights (Aurora borealis) aren't exactly a place on
            Earth. They are a naturally occurring atmospheric phenomenon that
            can happen in many places around the Northern hemisphere, between 60
            and 75 degrees of latitude. They are a dancing frenzy between the
            goodess of dawn, Aurora, and Boreas, the northern wind. There' s a
            corresponding phenomenon in the South hemisphere, the Aurora
            australis. As I live between 37 and 42 degrees of latitude, Auroras
            are one of my dream destinations.
          </p>
          <p>
            But what are Auroras after all? When a solar storm comes towards
            Earth some of the energy and small particles can travel down the
            magnetic field lines at the north and south poles into Earth's
            atmosphere. There, the particles interact with gases in our
            atmosphere resulting in beautiful displays of light in the sky -
            Auroras. Oxygen gives off green and red light. Nasa clearly explains
            this stuning phenomenon using didatic films that you can watch
            <a href="https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/aurora/en/">here</a>.

          <h2>When and where to see it</h2>
          <p>
            The aurora borealis are potentially visible under dark skies from
            late August to mid-April preferably under a clear, cloudless sky.
            While they occur year round they are weaker than sunlight and
            therefore sightings aren't possible from May to July and for most of
            August. Spring and autumn generally provide more stable weather
            conditions and milder temperatures plus there is greater aurora
            activity around the equinoxes. November through to February offer
            the darkest skies and longer evenings for maximum sky-gazing. The
            strongest lights tend to appear between 9pm and 2am, though the best
            sightings often occur between 11pm and midnight. Between 4am and 5pm
            there is generally too much daylight to see the aurora – exceptions
            are the darkest months of the year and higher latitudes such
            Svalbard, where it is dark 24/7 from mid-Nov to end of January.

            According to
            <a
              href="https://www.timeout.com/travel/best-places-to-see-the-northern-lights-aurora"
              >Timeout</a
            >, the best 7 places to see the Northern Lights are:
          </p>
          <p>
            1. Norway: Tromsø is a popular place for Northern Light hunters to
            base themselves. You can sometimes even spot the lights from the
            town itself. If you're taking your quest very seriously, there are
            few places better than Svalbard for spotting the lights. The world's
            northernmost year-round settlement, Svalbard is in darkness
            constantly between November and February, providing optimum
            opportunities. Just make sure you take an official tour rather than
            heading out into the wilderness on your lonesome. This is polar bear
            territory.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Greenland Light pollution is minimal in wild, rural Greenland. If
            you visit during the winter months, your chance of spotting the
            Nothern Lights is pretty good. The lights can be seen from
            Greenland’s capital Nuuk, while Kangerlussuaq and Sisimiut are good
            places to base yourself. Southern Greenland might be better if you
            don’t love the biting cold, but if you’re feeling brave, you should
            book a trip to beautiful Ilulissat in northern Greenland.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Canada Though you might spot them anywhere in Canada, much of
            Northern Canada falls into the Aurora Zone and is a brilliant place
            to try your luck. The Northwest Territories are your best bet.
            Churchill in northern Manitoba is another spot popular with
            aurora-hunters for a reason, as are Yukon, Nunavut, Newfoundland and
            Labrador. You might even get lucky in Alberta during autumn – the
            lights have been known to make an appearance in Banff National Park.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Iceland Reykjavik is popular with aurora-spotters, who base
            themselves in the city and head out into the darkness at night on
            organised tours or in rented cars. You can even see the lights in
            town, especially in the Oskjuhlid forest. But heading away from the
            bright lights will aid your chances. The Westfjords and North
            Iceland have longer hours of darkness and statistically less
            frequent cloud cover.
          </p>
          <p>
            5. Sweden Swedish Lapland is an ideal aurora-hunting playground,
            with plenty of wholesome outdoor activities to keep you occupied
            while waiting. For the best chance of seeing the Northern Lights,
            head to the Aurora Sky Station in Abisko National Park. Kiruna, the
            country’s northernmost city, is also an ideal base, as is the nearby
            village of Jukkasjärvi (home to the Ice Hotel). For stunning scenery
            and isolation, visit the tiny village of Porjus.
          </p>
          <p>
            6. Scotland When the conditions are right, the Northern Lights can
            be spotted anywhere in Scotland – they have been sighted as far
            south as Edinburgh – but northern Scotland, which sits at a similar
            latitude to parts of Norway, is where you’re most likely to get an
            eyeful of the dancing colours. The islands of Shetland, Orkney,
            Harris, Lewis and the most northerly top of Skye all get regular
            visits from the lights. Other good places to try your luck are
            Caithness, the northernmost edge of the Scottish mainland, and the
            Cairngorms National Park.
          </p>
          <p>
            7. Finland Finnish Lapland plays host to the Northern Lights an
            impressive 200 nights a year. You’ll want to visit this northern
            region in winter when 24-hour summer daylight is replaced with
            almost constant night. Popular bases for aurora-spotting holidays
            include remote Utsjoki in the far north, Kilpisjärvi in the west and
            the skiing town of Levi. In the central Lapland resort of Luosto,
            bells are rung when the aurora makes an appearance. Handy!
